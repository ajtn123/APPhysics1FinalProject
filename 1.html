      <h3>Angle of Attack</h3>
      <p>
        In fluid dynamics, angle of attack (AOA, α) or is the angle between a reference line on a body (often the chord line of an airfoil) and the
        vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving. Angle of attack is the angle between the
        body's reference line and the oncoming flow. This article focuses on the most common application, the angle of attack of a wing or airfoil
        moving through air.

      <h3>Wind Tunnel</h3>
      <p>
        A wind tunnel is "an apparatus for producing a controlled stream of air for conducting aerodynamic experiments". The experiment is conducted
        in the test section of the wind tunnel and a complete tunnel configuration includes air ducting to and from the test section and a device for
        keeping the air in motion, such as a fan. Wind tunnel uses include assessing the effects of air on an aircraft in flight or a ground vehicle
        moving on land, and measuring the effect of wind on buildings and bridges. Wind tunnel test sections range in size from less than a foot
        across, to over 100 feet (30 m), and with air speeds from a light breeze to hypersonic.
