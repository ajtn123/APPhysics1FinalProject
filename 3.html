      <h2>Experiment Setup</h2>
      <h3>Material</h3>
      <ul class="multi-column">
        <li>Electronic scale</li>
        <li>Stand fan</li>
        <li>Cardboard</li>
        <li>Tape</li>
        <li>Corner brackets</li>
        <li>bolts and nuts</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The wind tunnel consists of two segments, each built from four pieces of cardboard joined together using corner brackets and bolts. The entire
        tunnel is elevated approximately 15 cm above the table surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hole is drilled through the bottom surface of the tunnel, directly above an electronic scale placed beneath it. A stand passes through this
        hole and rests on the scale. A model wing is mounted on top of the stand with a damper hinge, positioned at the center of the tunnel. Weights
        are added to the base of the stand to ensure stability during experiment.
      </p>
      <p>A stand fan is installed at one end of the tunnel to generate airflow.</p>

      <h3>Changes during Experiment</h3>
      <p>
        The electronic scale was initially set inside the tunnel, along with all structure on top of it. It was moved out due to concerns about
        airflow interference.
      </p>
      <p>The first model wing was smaller, wraped by tape, and curved on the top surface. Is was replaced with a lager piece of flat cardboard.</p>
